<h1 align="center">TicTacToe with JavaFX</h1>

After learning Java, I decided I wanted to learn JavaFX to help me build nicer-looking UIs, as I did not enjoy using Swing. This is the second project I built after learning JavaFX (the first being [FlappyBird-JavaFX](https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/FlappyBird-JavaFX)).

<p>
  The project uses the minimax algorithm to play TicTacToe against a player. I have also implemented two instances of the controller class â€” one with alpha-beta pruning and one without.
