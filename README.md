<h1 align="center">TicTacToe with JavaFX</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
After learning Java, I decided I wanted to learn JavaFX to help me build nicer-looking UIs, as I did not enjoy using Swing. This is the second project I built after learning JavaFX (the first being [FlappyBird-JavaFX](https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/FlappyBird-JavaFX)).
</p>
<p>
  The project uses the minimax algorithm to play TicTacToe against a player. I have also implemented two instances of the controller class â€” one with alpha-beta pruning and one without.
</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>
Run the main method in the TicTacToeApplication class
</p>

<h2>Controls:</h2>
<p>
  Its TicTacToe (The losing player plays first, X is first initially)
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Left Click:</strong> Places a peice</li>
    <li><strong>Space Bar or Left Click(on Game Over screen):</strong> Reset the game.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results:</h2>
